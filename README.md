# Rota Optimizer Demo
## About
This project presents a demonstration of a Rota Balancer system. Designed to optimize workforce allocation, this tool dynamically manages daily and hourly staff coverage, intelligently realigning break times for workers to balance workload based on hourly trade demands and other operational factors.

## Features
* **Daily/Hourly Cover Management:** Helps ensure adequate staffing levels throughout the day and specific hours.
* **Dynamic Break Re-alignment:** Adjusts worker break times to prevent understaffing during peak periods and distribute workload evenly.
* **Workload Balancing:** Aims to synchronize staff presence with hourly trade requirements and other influencing factors for optimal operational efficiency.

## Technologies Used
This demo is a client-side application built with fundamental web technologies:
* **HTML:** For the structure and content of the application.
* **CSS:** For styling and visual presentation.
* **JavaScript:** For the core logic and interactive functionality of the rota balancing mechanism.

## Project Status & Validation
This demo has been rigorously tested and validated within a pan-European enterprise environment, demonstrating its potential efficacy in a real-world operational setting. Please note that this is a conceptual demo and not a production-ready system.
